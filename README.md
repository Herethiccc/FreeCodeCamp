This 'FreeCodeCamp' repo has no other purpose than centralizing modules I completed.

freeCodeCamp is a highly efficient education charity that allows you to learn IT related stuff (mainly development in various languages) for free.
Join the experience and if you feel like it, feel free to donate at [www.freecodecamp.org/donate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate).
